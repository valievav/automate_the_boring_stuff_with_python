# automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python
This repository contains my solutions to projects from the ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) 
book by Al Sweigart.  

It includes 3 types of files: 
- **Practice Projects** (package name is plain) - projects I written solutions for from scratch
- **Example Tasks** (package name contains "Example_Task" part) - projects, that have solutions in the book, but which I did try to solve 
myself. That's why most of them are different from the book or have additional enhansements to the logic.
- **Tests** (package name contains "tests" part) - tests for couple of sample functions.

Hope you find it useful. Thank you for visiting this repository and happy Pythoning! üêç
