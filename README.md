# automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python
Welcome!

This repository contains my solutions to the excercises from ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) 
book by Al Sweigart.  

It includes 3 types of files: 
- **Practice Projects** - exersises I solved myself (no solution in a book).
- **Example Tasks** (files with "Example_Task" suffix) - exercises, that have solution in the book, but which I solved on my own. 
                     Because of that most of them are different from the book and have additional enhancements to the logic.
- **Tests** (files with "tests" suffix) - tests to some sample functions.

Hope you'll find it useful! Thank you for visiting this repository and happy Pythoning! üêç
